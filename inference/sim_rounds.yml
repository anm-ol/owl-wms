# Configuration for simulating entire rounds of Tekken video generation.
# This file centralizes all parameters for running simulate_rounds.py

# --- Core Paths ---

# Path to the main model configuration file used during training.
# Example: The tekken_nopose_large model config.
model_config_path: "configs/tekken_nopose_large.yml"

# REQUIRED: Path to the trained model checkpoint (.pt file).
# This must be a raw checkpoint containing only the core model weights.
model_ckpt_path: "/mnt/data/laplace/owl-wms/checkpoints/tekken_nopose_dmd_L_ema/step_4000.pt"

# REQUIRED: Path to the directory containing the preprocessed data (latents, actions).
# This directory should have subfolders for each round (e.g., 'round_001/').
data_dir: "/mnt/data/laplace/owl-wms/preproccessing/cached_dcae_nopose/val"

# Path to save the generated output videos.
output_dir: "simulation_output"

# --- Simulation Parameters ---

# The index of the first frame from the latent data to use as the initial context.
# This is typically 0.
starting_frame_index: 0

# The length of the initial context given to the model before it starts generating.
# This is usually a small number, e.g., 4 or 16 frames.
initial_context_length: 4

# --- Performance Parameters ---

# Enable torch.compile for the model and VAE to accelerate inference.
compile: false
